Playframework filter to redirect http to https.  I found myself needing the same code over and over in multiple projects so I decided to keep it DRY.

#### Version information
* `2.5.0` to `2.5.x` (last: `1.0.1` - [master branch](https://github.com/enalmada/play-https-redirect/tree/master))

Releases are on [mvnrepository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.enalmada) and snapshots can be found on [sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/github/enalmada).

## Quickstart
Clone the project and run `sbt run` to see a sample application.
To test locally, add -Dhttps.port=9443 in your JAVA_OPTS or SBT_OPTS env
Don't turn on hsts unless you are 100% sure you never want to go back to http.


```
## HTTP to HTTPS redirect filter settings
httpsRedirect {
  modes=["Prod", "Dev"]
  excluded=["/health"]
  hsts {
    enabled=true
    maxAge=31536000
    preload = true
    includeSubDomains = true
  }
}
```
